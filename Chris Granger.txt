Hi Chris,

I'd like to introduce myself. First snapshot: I'm the founder of MakerBeam, a 2009 Kickstarter alum. There's a Kickstarter right now that uses my product, which is super meta and shows that open hardware is a real thing. Heady times.

My day job, this month, is parser writing. I've been keen on Light Table since the inception, though it didn't reach my inbox before the actual Kickstarter ended, alas. 

I have an audacious project in mind. It's close enough to being Light Table that it probably should be, but is fundamentally different. 

The premise is a code creation process driven by a parser of the target language, with all changes to the parse tree effected by operational transformation. 

A project, instead of being a collection of snapshots of mutable states, becomes a single story of successive transformation, immutable by default, and generated as an abstract syntax tree, token by token.

If I wrote this in the wilderness, I'd use Clojure for the logic and immutability, node-webkit for the UI, and Antlr for the parsing. It would look a lot like Light Table, but under the hood...

I live in Oakland. I'd love to get a beverage and discuss.
