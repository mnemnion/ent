\f0\fs40 \cf0 a swift note about time travel\
\
 time travel is provided by the structure of Hydra; since you can do it, you inevitably will, but that doesn't make it a good idea. There are two obvious use cases: refactoring a statement by going back to the original definition and altering it is the first. The second is: you're in the past, wandering around the codebase, and you find a mistake or something that should be fixed. Feel free to fix it! If you fixed it twice, you'll know as soon as you propagate, if you fixed it differently, propagation will tell you that too, and if you didn't fix it before, it's fixed now.  }
