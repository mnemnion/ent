the metaparser

Hydra will have a metaparser, which takes a file and decides what kind of format it's in. 

This will be fun to write: it's a series of parser rules, the order and structure of which is designed to eliminate ambiguity between language files by matching distinctive structures. 

In fact, to really make Hydra into the many-headed beast it should be, all parsers should be branches from a single ur parser that accepts all input as a sequence of bytes.
